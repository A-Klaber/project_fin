# Electric Vehicle Analysis2 


## Overview 

Our client a large nationwide property developer, is looking to build new electronic charging stations throughout the US.  We are tasked to determine where Electronic charging stations should be added in the US based on EVs that are registered in the area.  

Also considering determining where charging stations will be needed based on gaps in coverage in sparse areas.  There may be some value in ensuring there are charging stations in sparse areas for cross state travel.


## Plan

Analysis of Electronic vehicle registration and electronic vehicle sales to determine area that will benefit from more charging station additions.  Determining average miles per charge and determining potential area of need for charging stations.  


## Resources/Data

*Alternative Fuels Data Center: Maps and Data - Electric Vehicle Registrations by State (energy.gov)

*Alternative Fuels Data Center: Maps and Data - Average Range and Efficiency of U.S. Electric Vehicles (energy.gov)

*https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10567     (US Plug in Electric Vehicle Sales By Model)

*https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fueling-station-locations-422f2   alt_fuel_stations (Jul 29 2021).csv


## Questions to Answer

*What areas will need EV charging stations with the steady increase of Electronic vehicle sales

*What areas may need EV charging stations due to sparsity of coverage needs



## Communication

Since having found the value of using Slack thought this term of class, we relied on Slack as our main communication tool.  We also were also all able to collaborate via zoom meetings.
