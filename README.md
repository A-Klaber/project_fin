# Electric Vehicle Analysis

## Overview of Project
Our client a large nationwide property developer, is looking to build new electronic charging stations throughout the US.  We are tasked to determine where Electronic charging stations should be added in the US based on EVs that are registered in the area.  

Also considering determining where charging stations will be needed based on gaps in coverage in sparse areas.  There may be some value in ensuring there are charging stations in sparse areas for cross state travel.

## Plan
Analysis of Electronic vehicle registration and electronic vehicle sales to determine area that will benefit from more charging station additions.  Determining average miles per charge and determining potential area of need for charging stations.  


## Resources/Data
*Alternative Fuels Data Center: Maps and Data - Electric Vehicle Registrations by State (energy.gov)

*Alternative Fuels Data Center: Maps and Data - Average Range and Efficiency of U.S. Electric Vehicles (energy.gov)

*https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10567     (US Plug in Electric Vehicle Sales By Model)


## Topic Choice
Coming to an agreement on a topic was not an easy task.  However, once we were able to locate some recent data on electronic vehicles, the ideas started flowing.  Maybe it's the high gas prices, or the fact that many car companies are promising to refocus and produce more electric vehicles.  Ultimately, we found this to be an interesting topic with a wealth of data to explore.
