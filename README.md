# ElectricVehicle Analysis

## Overview of Project
Our client a large nationwide property developer, is looking to build new electronic charging stations throughout the US.  We are tasked to determine where Electronic charging stations should be added in the US based on EVs that are registered in the area.  

Also considering determining where charging stations will be needed based on gaps in coverage in sparse areas.  There may be some value in ensuring there are charging stations in sparse areas for cross state travel.

## Plan
Analalysis of Electronic vehicle registration and electronic vehicle sales to determine area that will benefit from more charging station additions.  Determing average miles per charge and determining potential area of need for charging stations.
